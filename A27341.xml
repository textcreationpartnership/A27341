            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR, You cannot but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when I was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your good Company, there was a Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as delivered in the Creed call'd <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s; and that there was a Perſon preſent who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Opinion to be, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Belief of that Doctrine as neceſſary to eternal Salvation, and the Reaſons he gives for that his Opinion are briefly theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becauſe (ſaith he) no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (nor I verily think by any Church) ever baptized into the Faith, as contained in that Creed, but in the Apoſtles Creed.</item>
               <item>2. As Perſons are admitted by the Church of <hi>England</hi> into her Communion without the Belief of that Creed, ſo in her Office of the Viſitation of the Sick they are not examined in it, but upon a Declaration of ſtedfaſt Faith in all the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed (in which I could never yet find any thing of an <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Trinity) Abſolution is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in the Office for Burial that Perſon is owned to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brother: and in the laſt Clauſe of the Exhortation, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding the Apoſtles Creed, in that Office of Viſitation 'tis plain, that he that believes the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed, doth believe as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Man ſhould. And,</item>
               <item>3. Becauſe in the Exhortation, almoſt at the End of Office of Publick Baptiſm, he that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Belief of the Articles of the Apoſtles Creed, is ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God; and in the ſame Exhortation the Child (as to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48287:2"/>Faith) is chiefly to be taught the Creed, which I preſume was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed.</item>
               <item>4. Look upon the third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the Church-Catechiſm, where the Child is taught to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that his Godfathers and Godmothers did promiſe that he ſhould believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, which Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the Child being required to rehearſe, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. is directed, and ſays the Apoſtles Creed; and it is alſo evident by the Office of Baptiſm, no other can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the Baptiſmal Vow.</item>
               <item>5. In the Office of Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the firſt Queſtion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Perſon to be confirmed doth declare in the Preſence of God and the Congregation, that he doth renew the ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Vow that was made in his Name at Baptiſm, which was to believe the Articles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed; and neither the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor yet any other ever dared yet to impoſe the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſm, no more than <hi>Pius</hi> IV. and his Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> dared to impoſe their novel Faith as a Condition of the ſame, but content themſelves (as we do) with that which bears the Name of the Apoſtles, as containing the Abſtract of all Primitive Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. See Dr. <hi>Ford</hi>'s Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord-Mayor, <hi>June</hi> 5, 1692. p. 18. And by ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice 'tis apparent, as the Doctor there clearly argues, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Men may talk, yet they do not believe thoſe Articles to be <hi>de fide,</hi> and neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the Profeſſion of which they admit by Baptiſm Proſelytes into the Church; and conſequently that Men cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thoſe from their Church, for not believing thoſe Articles that they dare not impoſe, no nor mention to thoſe they admit to be Members of their Church.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But I find 'tis commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as delivered in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, is contained in the 39 Articles; and that every Clergy-man that holds any Place of Profit in the Church, is bound to ſubſcribe them, and give his unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent to the ſame. To which may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> That thoſe 39 Articles are not Articles of Faith but Peace, as ſeveral of her moſt learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have plainly declared. See Archbiſh. <hi>Bromhal</hi>'s <hi>Schiſm guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> p. 396. Which Paſſage is both cited and approved by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Biſhop <hi>Fowler,</hi> in his <hi>Free Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.</hi> And the Biſhops <hi>Laud, Taylor, Sanderſon,</hi> have expreſſed themſelves to the ſame purpoſe. And in a word, the Title of the Articles ſays as much.</item>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48287:2"/>
               <item>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Becauſe, if the 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were Articles of Faith, the Church would baptize into them.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> If the 39 Articles became Articles of Faith by ſubſcribing them, then it would follow that the Clergy would have more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith than the Laiety, and then further there would be more than one Faith, which is contrary to the expreſs Words of Holy Scripture.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> Becauſe in the ſixth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle the Church declares that all things neceſſary to Salvation are contained in the Holy Scriptures; and thereto nothing is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor from it any thing to be diminiſhed; the Canonical Books of the Holy Scripture are in that 6th Article named, &amp; thereby the 39 Articles are excluded, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than agreeable with them. But I find it's further objected,</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That the 8th Article re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that the <hi>Nicene, Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and Apoſtles Creeds be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly received and believed; and hence it ſeems evident, that the Church impoſes the Belief of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as delivered in the Creed called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> To this it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (1) 'Tis not ſaid as neceſſary to Salvation. (2) In that very 8th Article the Church doth not abſolutely require the Belief of it, but for that, or ſuppoſing it may be proved firmly from the Holy Scripture: And that this is the Meaning of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth appear, <hi>1ſt.</hi> By the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Queſtion, and Anſwer in the Form of ordering Prieſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating Biſhops, ſet forth by Authority, where it is apparent that the Perſon to be ordained Prieſt is directed by that Form to declare, that he is perſwaded that the Holy Scriptures contain ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently all Doctrines required of Neceſſity to Salvation; and that he hath determined to teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as required of Neceſſity to eternal Salvation) but that which he ſhall be perſwaded may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and proved by the H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You may ſee the like in the Form of conſecrating Biſhops, the ſecond Queſtion and Anſwer, and by the fourth Queſtion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in the publick Form of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Prieſts: The Prieſt is to promiſe to drive away all erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtrange Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Word: Now I preſume that every erronious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to be look'd upon as ſtrange, and that we muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an erronious Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has been of long ſtanding.</p>
            <p>And further, in the fourth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and Anſwer, in the Form of conſecrating Biſhops: The Biſhop to be conſecrated doth promiſe to drive away all erronious and ſtrange Doctrine contrary to God's Word, and both privately and publickly to call upon others to do the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48287:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But to end, ſuppoſing but not granting that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had required the Belief of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, as delivered in the Creed call'd the <hi>Athanaſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. She doth not aſſume the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Infallibility, for then ſhe would be guilty of that which ſhe charges (and that juſtly) as a Crime on the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In Article 20 the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſets forth what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is ſhe claims in Matters of Faith, or rather diſclaims what Authority ſhe hath not.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> It's not an Authority to impoſe any thing contrary to the written Word of God. Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly.</hi> An Authority to expound one Place of Scripture that it may be contrary to another; plainly that as the Church ought not to decree any thing contrary to the ſame, ſo beſides the ſame ſhe ought not to decree any thing to be believed for Neceſſity of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Now from what hath been ſaid it ſeems to follow, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Belief of the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity as delivered in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation. For,</p>
            <p>If ſhe baptizeth not into that Faith, if he is ſaid to believe as a Chriſtian Man ought to believe, that declares his Belief of only the Apoſtles Creed, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon owned as a Chriſtian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if thereby he is ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God; to believe all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; if the Perſon to be confirmed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news only a Promiſe to believe the Apoſtles Creed; if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Holy Trinity is not to be believed by being in the 39 Articles, or by their being ſubſcribed to, they being no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, as by the Title of them and Preface before them is evident, no Perſon being baptized into them. And the ſixth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being a Key to all the reſt, and ſhewing us very plainly how far they are to be believed; and if whatſoever elſe is before aſſerted is evidently to be ſeen, it appears for thoſe Reaſons, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, as ſet down in the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, is not ſuch an Article of Faith, in the Opinion of the Church, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be believed in order to eternal Salvation. Thus, Sir, according to my mean Ability, I have faithfully and conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged my Promiſe, and beg the Favour of a Line, if this come ſafe to your Hands. I am,</p>
